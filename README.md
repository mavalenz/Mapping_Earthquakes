# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview
### Our mission is to help build insightful data visualizations with interactive features on earthquakes from around the world. We will do so by creating earthquake maps that are informative and easy to use on desktop and mobile phones. In this role we will:
- Support website and mobile application development by using the latest earthquake GeoJSON data from the US Geological Survey website.
- Traverse and retrieve the earthquake data using JavaScript and the D3 and leaflet libraries.
- Plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request.
- Add fault lines on the map to illustrate the relationship between location and frequency of seismic activity and tectonic plates.
